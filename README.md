# Badass Chicks in Film


This is an open source iOS App for Women Who Code.

Admittedly messy and hacked together in a couple of weekends, open for collaboration with others.

Since the back end is Parse, we can use the REST API for Android, web (Ruby, Javascript, etc) projects. Just ask me for the Secret Keys.
